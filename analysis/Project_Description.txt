Title: PokéPal
Description: "As a user, you can log in either as a Trainer or a Nurse (Hospital staff).
              As a Trainer, you can view your Pokémon collection, register new catches,
              and keep track of what you have. You can click on any Pokémon to view its stats and,
              if possible, evolve it. If a Pokémon is not at full health, you can send it to the hospital for healing.
              Additionally, there's a calendar feature where you can schedule and keep track of upcoming gym battles.
              As a Nurse, you can view the Pokémon that need healing and check how long it will take for them to fully recover."
